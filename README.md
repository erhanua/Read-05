1-What is the purpose of CSS?
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. It allows you to create visually engaging web pages and user interfaces.
2-What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?
Three ways to insert CSS into your project:

a. Inline CSS: This involves adding the CSS directly within the HTML element using the "style" attribute.

b. Internal (or Embedded) CSS: This involves placing the CSS within a <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML document.

c. External CSS: This involves linking to an external .css file. This is the most common method for applying styles because it allows a single .css file to control the appearance of multiple pages.

3-Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.
CSS
p {
    color: red;
}
HTML
<p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
